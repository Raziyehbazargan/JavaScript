/*Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. 
Itâ€™s very useful to improve the performance of large scale web applications. 
There might be some functionality in a web page which requires time-consuming computations. 
If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single threaded language. 
Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. 
In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.
