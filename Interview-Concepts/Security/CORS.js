Explain CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
In some cases, you may want to allow certain cross-origin interaction, for example, between different domains that both belong to you.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP mechanism that uses HTTP headers to define origin permissions. Using CORS headers, you can inform the browser that resources 
from another origin have the rights to access resources on your page.

The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header may declare a single origin, a list of origins, or a wildcard (*). 
Of course, wildcard use is very risky but nevertheless up to the web application developer.
