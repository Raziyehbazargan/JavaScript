/* JSONP: is a method for sending JSON data without worrying about cross-domain issues.
JSONP does not use the XMLHttpRequest object. it uses <script> tag instead.

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers
 because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.

 These days, CORS is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack.
